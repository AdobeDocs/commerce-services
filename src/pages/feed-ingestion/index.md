# Feed ingestion REST endpoints

The Adobe Commerce Feed Ingestion service allows you to sync your catalog data straight to the Adobe Commerce services platform, bypassing the need to go through your Commerce instance, saving time and processing power.

The Feed Ingestion Service allows customers with large and/or complex catalogs to send data to Adobe Commerce services directly.

The Feed Ingestion Service decreases the time that it takes to process product changes by bypassing the Adobe Commerce instance and moving catalog data from a third-party Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) directly to Adobe Commerce services.
