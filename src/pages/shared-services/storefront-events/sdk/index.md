# Adobe Commerce Events SDK

This package serves as the foundation for eventing on an Adobe Commerce storefront. It provides access to a common data layer, and an event publishing and subscription service. You can use the [Adobe Commerce Event Collector](../collector/index.md) package to listen for the events and send them to Adobe Commerce for processing.

If you are using the Data Connection module, you can skip this installation topic. The module automatically deploys the SDK for you. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/data-connection/fundamentals/connect-data#data-collection).

## Installation

This SDK can be used as a hosted script, or bundled in a JavaScript application. The script version is hosted on [cdn](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk@1/dist/index.js), and the bundled version is hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk).

To load the SDK as a script, use the following snippet.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk@1/dist/index.js"></script>
```

To install the script as a dependency, run this command.

```bash
npm install @adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk
```

### Confirm SDK is Available

If you used the CDN to install the script, you need to confirm the SDK asset has downloaded successfully. You can check if the download was successful by running the following code:

```bash
//Module Load
import mse from "@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk";
if(!mse) return;

//AMD Load
require(['magentoStorefrontEvents'], function (magentoStorefrontEvents) {
        if(!magentoStorefrontEvents) return; 
```

To prevent issues, always keep the script or bundled version updated to the latest release.

## Quick Start

Once imported, you have access to the four main functions of the Events SDK.

-  [Context](context.md) - Set context data
-  [Publish](publish.md) - Publish events
-  [Subscribe](subscribe.md) - Subscribe to events
-  [Unsubscribe](unsubscribe.md) - Unsubscribe from events

The following code example shows how to get started.

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text" />

Relevant context data must be populated before publishing events that require it.

```javascript
import mse from "@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk";

// subscribe to events
mse.subscribe.pageView(pageViewHandler);

// set context data
mse.context.setPage(/* page context */);

// publish events
mse.publish.pageView();

// unsubscribe from events
mse.unsubscribe.pageView(pageViewHandler);
```
