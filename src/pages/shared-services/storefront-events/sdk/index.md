# Adobe Commerce Events SDK

This package serves as the foundation for eventing on an Adobe Commerce storefront. It provides access to a common data layer, and an event publishing and subscription service. You can use the [Adobe Commerce Event Collector](../collector/index.md) package to listen for the events and send them to Adobe Commerce for processing.
