# Catalog management APIs

Developers creating ecommerce sites to sell to various businesses can use the Catalog Management Admin APIs to setup, configure, and manage catalogs and catalog tools for product search and recommendations. The Catalog Management APIs are implemented as a GraphQL (Graph Query Language) endpoint to manage the channels and policies used to setup and manage catalogs.
