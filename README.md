# Adobe Commerce Merchandising Services Documentation

This repository contains the code for the [Merchandising Services documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/) website. It is built using [Adobe Edge Delivery Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview) and deployed to [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/).

The site covers APIs and tools for managing and using commerce catalog and event data programmatically, including the Data Ingestion API, Merchandising API, Storefront Events SDK, Product Recommendations SDK, and Commerce Reporting API.

## Quick start

For local development, you need to start three servers:

1. **Content server** (this repo):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Code server** ([adp-devsite](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite)):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite
   cd adp-devsite
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Runtime connector** ([devsite-runtime-connector](https://github.com/aemsites/devsite-runtime-connector)):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aemsites/devsite-runtime-connector
   cd devsite-runtime-connector
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Once all three servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/commerce/services`.

For common utilities and documentation, see the [centralized README](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-utils/blob/main/README.md).

## Testing and linting

### Markdown linting

To lint Markdown files before pushing:

```bash
npm run lint:md
```

To automatically fix linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint:md:fix
```

### Content validation

To check internal and external links, validate front matter, and more:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### TOC validation

To validate the table of contents file:

```bash
npm run test:config
```

## GraphQL API reference

The Merchandising GraphQL API reference is generated using [SpectaQL](https://github.com/anvilco/spectaql). It introspects the live schema, injects custom descriptions from a metadata overlay, and filters the output to include only the queries and types supported by Adobe Commerce Optimizer.

The generated Markdown fragment is written to `src/pages/_includes/merchandising-api.md` and included in `src/pages/reference/graphql/index.md` via `<Fragment>`.

### Generating the reference

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and set the required variables:

   | Variable | Description |
   |---|---|
   | `TENANT_ID` | Your Adobe Commerce tenant ID |
   | `API_HOST` | GraphQL API hostname |
   | `CATALOG_VIEW_ID` | Catalog view ID for the `AC-View-Id` header |

1. Run the generator:

   ```bash
   npm run generate:merchandising-api-docs
   ```

See [`spectaql/README.md`](spectaql/README.md) for full configuration and script documentation.
